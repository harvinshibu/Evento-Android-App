## What is this?

Evento is an android application that is beneficial for people looking to conduct programs and functions. The main objective of Evento is a convenient method to book and view events in and around the user’s interests in the desired time. Evento is the application of project management to the creation and development of large-scale events. The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as event planning and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, catering, coordinating with third-party vendors, and emergency plans. The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the Olympics down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, charitable organizations, and interest groups hold events to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement. An event refers to a social gathering or activity, such as a festival, (for example a musical festival), a ceremony (for example a marriage), and a party (for example a birthday party …etc.). In addition, this app provides a chatting facility for smooth communication between the event manager and the client.
